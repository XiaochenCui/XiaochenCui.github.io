      <description>Function Calling Although the function calling was not summarized into the category of context switch generally, it is still a great choice to learn function calling as a warm-up.
A Simple Example The function calling is the most commonly used context switch for programmers. It gives a promise which the changes to variable doing by the callee would not take effect of the caller (unless deliberately or the variables of callee and caller point to the same memory location).</description>

      <description>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimm&amp;rsquo;d;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm&amp;rsquo;d;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;</description>
