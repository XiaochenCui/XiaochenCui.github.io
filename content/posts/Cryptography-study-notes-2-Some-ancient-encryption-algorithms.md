# Substitution cipher

- A key for a substitution cipher is a subsitution that basiclly says how to map our letters.

# Caesar cipher

- Actually is not really a cipher at all. And the reason is that it doesn't have a key.
- Basiclly is a substitution cipher where the substitution is fixed. Namely, it's a shift by three.

# Vigener cipher (16'th centry, Rome)

- Key is a word.

# Rotor Machines

- The Hibber machine (single rotor).
- The Enigma machine (3 - 5 rotor).
