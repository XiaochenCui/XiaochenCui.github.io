Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

Thou art more lovely and more temperate:

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;

And every fair from fair sometime declines,

By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;

But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;

Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,

When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,

So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

*能否把你比作夏日璀璨*

*你却比夏日更可爱温存*

*狂风璀璨五月花蕊姣妍*

*夏天匆匆离去毫不停顿*

*苍天明眸有时过于灼热*

*金色面容往往蒙上阴翳*

*一切优美形象不免褪色*

*偶然摧折或自然地老去*

*而你如仲夏繁茂不凋谢*

*秀雅风姿将永远翩翩*

*死神无法逼你气息奄奄*

*你将永胜与不朽诗篇*

*只要人能呼吸眼不盲*

*这诗和你将千秋流芳*
