# Overview

Fermat's little theorem states that if $p$ is a prime number, then for any integer $a$, the number $a^p - a$ is an integer multiple of $p$. In the notation of modular arithmetic, this is expressed as

{% raw %}
$$
    \begin{align*}
        a^p \equiv a\: (mod p)
    \end{align*}
$$
{% endraw %}

To be continued
