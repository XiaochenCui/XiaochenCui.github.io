I recently decided to rewrite [simple-db](https://github.com/XiaochenCui/simple-db-hw) with rust: [simple-db-rust](https://github.com/XiaochenCui/simple-db-rust)

Here is the motivation:
- The original java code is too verbose and cumbersome. And the code structure is unreasonable 
- Rust's type system and borrow checker could greatly help me develop this system
- I can use this opportunity to learn rust better
- Building an RDBMS from scratch will help me learn the database better
